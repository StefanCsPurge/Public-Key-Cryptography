# Public-Key-Cryptography

This proved to be a pretty nice course, 
with a unique spanish flavor thanks to our excellent lab teacher

Anyway, some of the most important conclusions are:
- the ElGamal cryptosystem is could be vulnerable as it is based on cyclic groups (reminds of Ceasar cipher)
- RSA (which is the most used crytosystem now) will be absolutely obsolete once 100% functional quantum computers will be developed.

La evoluci√≥n no se detiene.
